  title: Lists (Block Expression Shorthand)

  docs: |
    Emblem allows you to use `=` shorthand with block expressions. Because of this, you can achieve pretty succinct list declarations.

  emblem: |

    ul
      each items
        li Item name: #{name}

    / Shorter version:

    ul = each items
      li Item name: #{name}

  html: |
    <ul>
      {{#each}}
        <li>Item name: {{name}}
      {{/each}}
    </ul>

  title: linkTo (Text Content for Block Expressions)

  docs: |
    Some block helpers, such as Ember's `linkTo`, are often used with a small chunk of text as the content of the block. Emblem provides a shorthand in these instance: use a pipe '|' to separate a block helper declaration from its text content.

    This plays nicely with the Block Expression Shorthand described above.

  emblem: |

    / The following three are equivalent
    = linkTo "home"
      | Home

    = linkTo "home" | Home

    linkTo "home" | Home

    ul
      li = linkTo "index" | Home
      li = linkTo "about" | About Us


  html: |
    {{#linkTo "home"}}Home{{/linkTo}}

    <ul>
      <li>{{#linkTo "index"}}Home{{/linkTo}}</li>
      <li>{{#linkTo "about"}}About Us{{/linkTo}}</li>
    </ul>

  title: each/else

  docs: |
    This isn't strictly an Emblem pattern, but keep in mind that the `each` helper excepts an optional `else` portion that will be displayed when the list is empty or nonexistent.

  emblem: |

    each things
      p = name
    else
      p There are no things!

  html: |
    {{#each things}}
      <p>{{name}}</p>
    {{/else}}
      <p>There are no things!</p>
    {{/each}}
