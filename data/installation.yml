    ### Ruby on Rails

    To install Emblem on a Rails 3 project, just use add the following lines to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle`.

    Define your templates in `app/assets/templates` with the file extension `.emblem`. These will be automatically compiled and made available as Ember templates.

    For a working sample project, check out:<br>[github.com/machty/emblem-rails-demo](https://github.com/machty/emblem-rails-demo)

  shell: |
    # in your application's Gemfile
    gem "emblem-rails"

    # rebundle and restart your dev server
    bundle

    # now just create your .emblem files in app/assets/templates/


# HTML / Javascript

    ### Inline HTML / Javsacript

    You can easily test Emblem in the browser (works great for sites like jsbin.com) by just including the Emblem compiler script and wrapping your Emblem templates with `<script type="text/x-emblem">`.

    Your emblem script tags can also include `data-template-name` similar to inline Handlebars templates.

    See a working JSBin [demo here](http://jsbin.com/ulegec/17/edit).

  html: |

    <script src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/machty/emblemtest/emblem.js"></script>

    <script type="text/x-emblem" data-template-name="application">
      h1 Welcome to my App
      == outlet
    </script>
